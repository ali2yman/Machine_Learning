# Machine Learning Algorithms  

## Overview  
This repository contains implementations of various Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, both using **scikit-learn** and from **scratch**. The goal is to deepen understanding of ML concepts by applying algorithms directly and comparing their results with standard library implementations.  

## Features  
- Implementations of ML algorithms **from scratch**  
- Applications of ML models using **scikit-learn**  
- Code for **clustering, regression, and classification** tasks  
- Hands-on projects and experiments with real-world datasets  

## Implemented Algorithms  
### From Scratch  
- K-Means Clustering  
- Linear Regression  
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Trees  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  

### Using scikit-learn  
- K-Means Clustering (`sklearn.cluster.KMeans`)  
- Linear & Logistic Regression (`sklearn.linear_model`)  
- Decision Trees (`sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier`)  
- Support Vector Machines (`sklearn.svm.SVC`)  
- PCA (`sklearn.decomposition.PCA`)
